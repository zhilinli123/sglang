# Shepherd Model Gateway

**The high-performance inference gateway for production LLM deployments**

Route, balance, and orchestrate traffic across your LLM fleet with enterprise-grade reliability.

## Why Shepherd Model Gateway?

SMG sits between your applications and LLM workers, providing a unified control and data plane for managing inference at scale. Whether you're running a single model or orchestrating hundreds of workers across multiple clusters, SMG gives you the tools to do it reliably.

### :material-server-network: Full OpenAI Server Mode

With gRPC workers, SMG becomes a complete OpenAI-compatible server — handling tokenization, chat templates, tool calling, MCP, reasoning loops, and detokenization at the gateway level.

### :material-speedometer: High Performance

Native Rust implementation with gateway-side tokenization caching, token-level streaming, and sub-millisecond routing. Built for throughput at scale.

### :material-lightning-bolt: gRPC Mode

**Gateway = Full Server**

SMG handles everything: tokenization, chat templates, tool parsing, MCP loops, detokenization, and PD routing. Workers run raw inference on vLLM, SGLang, or TensorRT-LLM.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown>

### :material-swap-horizontal: HTTP Mode

**Gateway = Smart Proxy**

SMG handles routing, load balancing, and failover. Workers run full OpenAI-compatible servers (vLLM, SGLang, TRT-LLM). Supports PD disaggregation.

</div>

<div class="card" markdown>

### :material-cloud-outline: External Mode

**Gateway = Unified Router**

Route to OpenAI, Claude, Gemini through one endpoint. Mix self-hosted and cloud models seamlessly.
