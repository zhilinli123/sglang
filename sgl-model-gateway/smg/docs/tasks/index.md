| [Deploy to Kubernetes](deployment/kubernetes.md) | Production deployment with service discovery |
| [Configure TLS](deployment/tls.md) | Secure communications with TLS/mTLS |

## Task Format

Each task follows a consistent format:

1. **Prerequisites** — What you need before starting
2. **Steps** — Numbered steps to complete the task
3. **Verification** — How to confirm success
4. **Troubleshooting** — Common issues and solutions
